## Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.3.2
    ## ✔ tibble  2.1.3     ✔ dplyr   0.8.3
    ## ✔ tidyr   1.0.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✔ readr   1.3.1     ✔ forcats 0.4.0

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

**The fuction**

``` r
fill_missing = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    x[is.na(x)] = "virginica"
  }
  
  x[is.na(x)] = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  x
  
}
```

**Apply the
    fuction**

``` r
output = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, fill_missing)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(x, na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

## Problem 2

**Tidy the data**

``` r
filename_df = list.files("./data")

study_df = tibble(
  filename= list.files("./data"),
  readin = str_c("./data/", filename_df)
)%>%
  mutate(
    week_obs = map(readin, read_csv),
    arm = substr(filename, 1, 3),
    subject_id=substr(filename, 5, 6),
    arm = replace(arm, arm == "con", "control"),
    arm = replace(arm, arm == "exp", "experiment"),
    subject_id=as.numeric(subject_id)
  ) %>% 
  unnest %>% 
  select(-filename, -readin) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))
```

**Spaghetti plot**

``` r
study_df %>% 
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = subject_id)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ arm)
```

In the experiment arm, the observation on each subject increase over
time. Even though the increase is not steady, the overall trend is
incresing.

However, in the control arm, the observation on each subject appears no
increase over time. Even though the change is not steady, the overall
trend shows no increase.

At 1st week, the observations in experiment arm are similar to the
control arm. However, at 8th week, the observations in experiment arm
are higher than the control arm.
